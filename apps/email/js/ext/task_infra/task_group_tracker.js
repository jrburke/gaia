   * Tracks groups of one or more tasks and their spinoff tasks to provide higher
   * level completion notifications for users and so the `BatchManager` can flush
   * as early as possible without hand-waving timeout constants.
   *
   * We structure our tasks to be as small and as atomic as possible, which means
   * that they also are not a good level of granularity for higher level tasks.
   * For example, the core "sync_refresh" task does nothing directly, it is the
   * spun-off tasks that takes user-perceptible actions.  Which is where task
   * groups come in.
   *
   * Tasks are responsible for their own task group management.  This is ideal
   * because tasks are also responsible for consolidating redundant requests,
   * meaning they can also reuse existing task groups.  Additionally, since tasks
   * also manage overlays, this lets tasks like "sync_refresh" continue to expose
   * overlay state until the rest of the group completes.
   *
   * There are use-cases where it's handy for a task group to effectively contain
   * other groups.  Since the task-begets-task graph is a tree, we can easily
   * accomplish this by having groups be aware of their parent groups
