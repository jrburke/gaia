   *   implementation just describes what it wants to listen on.)
   * - Does bind magic so that the first argument to each trigger is an automagic
   *   helper that is the means of the trigger having a side-effect.  This allows
   *   us to optionally crank up the debug if we want, or just be lazy and
   *   simple.  We have the trigger call a method rather than just returning a
   *   value because triggers will usually not have to do anything, etc.
   *
   * TODO: either expose logging in here or in MailDB.
