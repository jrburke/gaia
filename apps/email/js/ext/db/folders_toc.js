     * specific folder id portion and convert it to a number and add one.
     *
     * There are other ways of doing this.  We used to store all folders in a
     * single per-account aggregate object with an explicit "meta" field.  Since
     * the folders are logically orthogonal and dealing with them independently
     * normalizes our handling of them, the meta field no longer had a home.  The
     * options were:
     * - This.  Rely on the fact that the folders are all in-memory all the time
     *   and so we can reliably choose an id without collision and can allocate
     *   id's in O(1) time following a one-off O(n) scan we were basically already
     *   doing.  The downside is that our "high water mark" is inherently not
     *   persisted, so if a folder is added and deleted and we restart and
     *   re-derive id's, we will reissue the id.  This really only matters to
     *   logging.
     * - Store the information in the account data which is also always-in-memory
     *   and therefore something we can manipulate using our atomicClobbers
     *   construct.  This is roughly what we do for account id allocation,
     *   except in that case it's sitting on the global config object.  I'm still
     *   not 100% happy with that, but the situation is somewhat different
     *   because:
     *   - The global config object is relatively boring and has very little in
     *     it.  Most settings are per-account.  This is relevant because it means
     *     that there is little chance for database triggers to be interested in
     *     the configuration.
     *   - Reuse of account id's is undesirable for paranoia reasons related to
     *     the database.  Also, there is useful debugging information in the
     *     account id's as they are directly correlated with user actions (but
     *     without having serious privacy implications.)  If a user reports a
     *     problem where logs show an extremely high account id, we know something
     *     very buggy is going on or the user may be a QA tester in disguise! ;)
     * - Store the information in some other data structure.  The best option
     *   would be an atomicClobber-able structure that just holds a lot of id's.
     *   This may still be the best way forward.  The worst option is a structure
     *   that is loaded on-demand and thus precludes atomic manipulations.  The
     *   ActiveSync implementation temporarily used its account-level sync-state
     *   since it already needed it for mapping purposes.  But this potentially
     *   could induce blocking against an online task if insufficiently careful
     *   (we like sync tasks to be able to hold their sync states exclusively
     *   while doing online things), so was not desirable.
     *
     * It's definitely okay to revisit this informed by time and implementation
     * regret.
