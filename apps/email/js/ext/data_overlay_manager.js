   * Data overlays are bonus data that may change with a high frequency that we
   * send to the front-end along-side our more persistent database records (which
   * necessarily change with a lower frequency.)  The information in data overlays
   * is currently always derived from complex tasks, but in the future, it might
   * also come from some type of extension like a caching-bugzilla-looker-upper.
   *
   * Overlays work in both a push and a pull capacity:
   * - Pull: We want to send a database record (ex: a MessageInfo) to the
   *   front-end.  In this case, we generate the overlay data on demand as we
   *   flush the records.
   * - Push: A complex task that publishes data overlays has experienced a change
   *   and so it wants to update any interested data overlays.  It tells us and
   *   we emit an appropriate event for any interested list proxies.
   *
   * Each front-end object receives the wire representation of its state (which
   * may be its DB state, but not always like when the account info would
   * otherwise include the password) plus a data overlay dictionary.  Each key in
   * the dictionary is the name of the task providing overlay data, and the value
   * is the value provided to us.
   *
   * In the case of ConversationInfo records, which are an app_logic controlled
   * aggregate, we currently simply have the tasks also expose appropriate
   * aggregate-level information as an overlay.  However, in the future, it might
   * make sense to allow the app_logic to also provide a similar mechanism to the
   * conv_churn but also for overlays.  Right now we believe all the overlay
   * information is universally desired, so there's no real benefit to providing
   * the ability to vary that information.
   *
   * ## Task Hookup ##
   *
   * For pull purposes, tasks are automatically registered with us by naming
   * convention on the tasks.  With the assistance of the TaskRegistry we consult
   * the tasks, providing them with the current state of the database record we
   * want overlay information about.  (Mainly for future enhancement reasons.)
   *
   * Pushes go in one of the arguments to `TaskContext.finishTask`.  Right now
   * this does mean that the payloads are fully built even if they don't need
   * to be.  Currently the payloads are not expected to be particularly expensive
   * and the simplicity for our implementation is deemed beneficial.
   *
   * Note that in the pull case, rather than actually pulling, we could
   * alternately have `deriveMemoryStateFromPersistentState` generate a list of
   * current overlays and latch those values, updating them as push updates occur.
   * This would result in a higher memory usage, and differing minor performance
   * implications.  The explicit pull structuring seems most beneficial for future
   * enhancement cases where on-demand-annotation logic could do raindrop-type
   * things like looking up the current state of Bugzilla bugs to annotate them
   * onto the message / conversation state, complete with clever caching.
